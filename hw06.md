## fetch-decode-execute        

### Fetch step
The fetch step is the same for each instruction:     

The CPU sends the contents of the PC to the MAR and sends a read command on the address bus     
In response to the read command (with address equal to PC), the memory returns the data stored at the memory location indicated by PC on the data bus     
The CPU copies the data from the data bus into its MDR      
A fraction of a second later, the CPU copies the data from the MDR to the instruction register for instruction decoding       
The PC is incremented so that it points to the next instruction. This step prepares the CPU for the next cycle.         
The control unit fetches the instruction's address from the memory unit.        

### Decode step 
The decoding process allows the CPU to determine what instruction is to be performed so that the CPU can tell how many operands it needs to fetch in order to perform the instruction. The opcode fetched from the memory is decoded for the next steps and moved to the appropriate registers. The decoding is done by the CPU's Control Unit.         

### Reading the effective address
This step evaluates which type of operation is to be performed. If it is a memory operation, the computer checks whether it's a direct or indirect memory operation:        

Direct memory operation - Nothing is done.      
Indirect memory operation - The effective address is read from memory.      
If it is an I/O or register instruction, the computer checks its type and executes the instruction.     

### Execute step
The function of the instruction is performed. If the instruction involves arithmetic or logic, the ALU is utilized. This is the only stage of the instruction cycle that is useful from the perspective of the end user. Everything else is overhead required to make the execute step happen.

IR : holds the instruction currently being executed or decoded.     
PC : is a processor register that indicates where a computer is in its program sequence.        

ACC : is a register in which intermediate arithmetic and logic results are stored.      

4) 
a和c就是一个计算机内的存储位置。     

# 2
1)
date and instruction.       

2)
yes.        

3)
按照书上的翻译：        
一串指令：
instruction specifier:1100 0 000      
operand specifier:0000000000000111        
前四位1100是一个指令，一般前四位数字是指令的代码，他告诉计算机该进行什么操作。      

0是寄存器标识符。一般我们只会用到accumulator，也就是用数字0表示。       

000表示寻址模式。000表示immediater addressing mode。这表示operand specifier里的数字就是一个我们想要操作的数字。     

001表示直接寻址，也就是说operand specifier里的数字是一个地址，这个地址里存储的内容才是我们想要操作的数字。

1) 
Assembly Language is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.       

2)
A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program.         

3)
Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state.        

4)
Functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.        

5)
Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out.
