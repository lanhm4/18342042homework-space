# Method of complements:   
 
 In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers.       

The nines' complement of a number is formed by replacing each digit with nine minus that digit. To subtract a decimal number y (the subtrahend) from another number x (the minuend) two methods may be used:      

In the first method the nines' complement of x is added to y. Then the nines' complement of the result obtained is formed to produce the desired result.       

In the second method the nines' complement of y is added to x and one is added to the sum. The leading digit '1' of the result is then discarded. Discarding the initial '1' is especially convenient on calculators or computers that use a fixed number of digits: there is nowhere for it to go so it is simply lost during the calculation. The nines' complement plus one is known as the ten's complement.     

# Byte   

The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer[1][2] and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures.

# Integer(computer science)   

In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers.   

# Floating point 

In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision.     

# 二： 

1) 假设这个二进制数用k位表示，则负数x = 2^k - |x|。    

2^k - |x| = 2^k - 1 - |x| + 1     

2^k-1 = (2-1)(2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) + L + 1)     

等式右边的数用二进制可以写为：1111....1(k个1)     

将|x|也表示为有k位的二进制数：1（0）1（0）1（0）.....1（0）       

则2^k - 1 - |x| = |x|的二进制表示按位取反（因为1-0=1,1-1=0。所以|x|上的每一位数无论是1还是0都应该取反）     

所以就可以将|x|按位取反再加一得到所求结果。
