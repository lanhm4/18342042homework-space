1) 
* A processing unit that contains an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers    
* A control unit that contains an instruction register and program counter   
* Memory that stores data and instructions    
* External mass storage    
* Input and output mechanisms    

2) 26   

3) 
* control unit    
* arithmetic logic unit (ALU)    

the basic parts of CPU don't include cache.    

4) 
Secondary storage, also known as auxiliary storage, auxiliary memory, secondary memory or external memory, is a non-volatile memory (does not lose stored data when the device is powered down) that is not directly accessible by the CPU, because it is not accessed via the input/output channels (it is an external device). In RAM devices (as flash memory) data can be directly deleted or changed.      

5) 
* CPU       
A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.     

* RAM       
Random-access memory (RAM /ræm/) is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used.     
* ROM       
Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices.         

* Bus       
In computer architecture, a bus (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers.      

* Parallel Computing        
Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously.        

* 云计算        
每个用户拥有一个终端（通常是性能相对而言比较差的计算机），通过互联网，下达指令，使用主机（计算能力非常强的计算机）的计算资源，完成一些大型任务。从而实现计算能力与资源的共享。      

7) 
3代表类型，之前已经有DDR，DDR2.         
1333代表数据速率（MT/s）
